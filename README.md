These pages are where I share various thoughts and notes on the things I'm working on. I would love to have a broader coverage of my interests. However I have learned that I have a fixed number of hours in a day and I have to choose what I spend those hours on. Therefore the topics covered in any given time period will change to reflect what I'm spending my time on.

Right now I focus on fitness, project management, memory, and learning webdev. I don't typically write much about fitness. And curently I don't have much to say about project management other than it being one of the most important skills for managing your life. So most of what I write will be memory and coding related.
